How would I build a 4x4 rotation matrix based on the surface normal of the landscape where the car is? Y is up and I'm not using OpenGL. I just want to apply a rotation matrix to my car's transformation matrix so it looks proper but I can't seem to be able to make such rotation matrix from a surface normal. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.  I've tried the following pseudo code but I'm getting weird results.",
